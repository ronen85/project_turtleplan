* 

* make a new map based on the model:
	load world with:
	  roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
	see world through rviz with:
	  roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch
	start amcl with:
	  roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo amcl_demo.launch

	milestones:
	~~~~~~~~~~~
	 v build a world
	 - build a launch file to load turtlebot to the world
	 - map the world and save it


* try navigate in a different world
  V make a new world
  V map the new world
  - try navigate in the new world

* load saved map
  - search internet

* make a map of the world and save it
  V load launch file with: 
	roslaunch project_turtleplan mapping_turtleplan.launch
  V teleoperation of the turtle with:
	roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
  V saved map to project_turtleplan/maps

* improve the mapping 
https://answers.ros.org/question/269280/how-to-make-better-maps-using-gmapping/
  V make the walls smaller
  V add items to map
  V make map default in main file
  V set the minimum score to 100 in gmapping.launch.xml /
  V decrease robot speed
  V test again


* change height of the walls to 1.2 m.
DONE

* install and run roscon.

* make a map to navigate in it
DONE: http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_gazebo/Tutorials/indigo/Make%20a%20map%20and%20navigate%20with%20it
bring up the TurtleBot simulation
	roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
start map building
	roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo gmapping_demo.launch
Use RViz to visualize the map
	roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch

* change the turtlebot initial location.
DONE: made a new file : kobukiPlan
this file spawns a turtle bot into map in a specific location with the argument turtle_pose.

these files 
* make a map. 
DONE: has to be in /opt/ros/indigo/share/turtlebot_gazebo/worlds under the name turtleplan.world.


* load this map with world_turtleplan.launch
DONE: change the argument in file main_turtleplan.launch
